## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This project follows a **Modular MVC-like architecture** for clear separation of concerns and scalability:

- **Models**: Handle database schema and data operations using raw SQL or ORM.
- **Controllers**: Contain business logic and interact with models to process client requests.
- **Routes**: Define API endpoints and link them to corresponding controllers.
- **Middleware**: Contains reusable functions like authentication, validation, etc.
- **Config**: Centralized configuration files like database connection.

This structure keeps code clean, maintainable, and easy to extend with new features.


## ‚ú® Features

- **User Authentication** using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure login and authorization.
- **CRUD Operations** for Posts and Comments.
- **Relational Database** (MySQL) with foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity.
- **Modular Architecture** with clear separation of concerns (Models, Controllers, Routes, Middleware).
- **Middleware-based Authentication** to protect routes.
- **Error Handling** with appropriate HTTP status codes and messages.
- **Timestamps** to track creation and update times of posts and comments.
- **Scalable Design** suitable for extending features like rich text support, notifications, etc.
